        The page where you post your image. The website should redirect to this location if you haven't posted yet, without showing the index.html file. Or at least that's how BeReal does it.

        <ul>
            <li>Plot upload (via file or clipboard). Make sure it's not too big.</li>
            <li>A caption, perhaps with LaTeX support using MathJax. Check it's not too long</li>
            <li>A color filter you can put on your image? That way people can spice up their plots if they upload the same-looking plot with different data.</li>
        </ul>
