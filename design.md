Beyond the core feature of uploading a plot and being able to see other people's plots, I thought we could spice it up a bit. E.g. 

* Commenting
* Being able to like plots?
* A weekly competition for the best color themes? Winners are perhaps barred from winning the next few weeks' competitions. Maybe their names are augmented with an emoji. Like

`bothron -> 👑bothron👑`
