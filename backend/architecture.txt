--- notes on MVP architecture ---

- Can we avoid passwords? don't really want to handle auth
    - basically want to minimize engagement with website. Best case for security is if webpage is totally static.

    - Could just make accounts accessible to everyone, like when2meet without the password option. Actions like uploading a figure could be done only through authorized email addresses.

- Assume few (<1000) users. So can do dumb simple things...
    - Store user information (username, email) in big JSON file

- Use gmail for email backend. Email users at 'beplotlib' time.

- How do users upload their submission? replying to email with attachment is probably easiest.
    - Then, run through imagemagick on server-side to catch malicious attachments
    - Then, place images in 'feed' directory
    - Python script reads images from 'feed' and generates HTML/CSS displaying timestamp ('on time'), username, and image

    - alternative idea ... generate 'upload' html webpage unique for each email, and deleted after each email. This might be harder to spoof knowing email / username.
        - JTD note: I like this idea. It sounds fast for the user and hopefully not too jank.
